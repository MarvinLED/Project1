/**
 * One accent hue per area of the app, so a screen is recognisable before its title is read.
 *
 * The hues are slots out of the same validated chart palette as `fluid/FluidChartColors.kt` — not a
 * second, uncoordinated set. The four bottom-nav accents are the ones that appear side by side, and
 * they validate as a categorical set against the nav's surface (worst adjacent CVD ΔE 17.3, all
 * ≥ 3:1 contrast). Nav items and headings always carry their label too, so identity is never on
 * colour alone.
 *
 * [ANALYSE], [GOALS], [LIBRARY], [BACKUP] and [ACHIEVEMENTS] deliberately stay on the theme
 * primary: they are cross-cutting views over the other areas' data, so claiming a hue of their own
 * would imply a peer relationship that isn't there — and red, the only slot left, reads as an error
 * state. The palette's nine hues are spent, which is the other half of the reason.

    // remaining direction that is neither a palette hue nor a near-twin of the braun above, and on
